To run the program type ./compfs [file] with the [file] being a text file of some kind.

Based on high level language input, code will output assembly language that accomplishes same tasks as high level langauge code.

Version control was done using git in the delmar server.  input git log to see versions.  If you have issues getting this to work please let me know and I can email proof of git being used.

As far as I can tell project seems to be working as intended.
